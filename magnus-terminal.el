;;; Commentary:

;; Shared terminal creation, key handling, and composer ownership for
;; interactive Magnus providers.  Loading this library does not eagerly load
;; vterm, so provider modules can expose non-terminal capabilities in batch
;; environments without requiring the optional package.  Creating a terminal
;; loads vterm before allocating a buffer.
;;
;; Post-launch text followed by Return has exactly one Magnus-side owner: this
;; module.  Durable callers use `magnus-terminal-submit'.  Replay-capable
;; external transports use `magnus-terminal-try-submit'.  They may acknowledge
;; synchronously when it returns `submitted'; when it returns `queued', Magnus
;; owns a pasted message until the ACCEPTED callback runs.  Such transports must
;; not call `vterm-send-string' and `vterm-send-return' themselves: a split
;; transaction can interleave with this module's timers and merge two composers.
