;;; Commentary:

;; Opt-in Codex support using the native Codex TUI as the single owner of each
;; session.  Magnus launches Codex directly in vterm, delivers coordination
;; messages through that terminal, and discovers new session IDs from Codex's
;; local rollout records so archived agents can be resumed later.
